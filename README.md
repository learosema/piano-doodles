# Lea's Piano Doodles and Strumming Exercises

## Motivation

I got a new hobby. Or, at least I revived an old one, which is playing the piano. I had a couple lessons in my childhood and
lost motivation. So, now, 35 years later, I try to pick it up again.

There's one catch though: it's really difficult to find music that makes me happy and is also easy enough for me
to play. So I downloaded [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/) and rolled something myself.

Turns out this is super fun. Meaybe this keeps me motivated ❤️.
